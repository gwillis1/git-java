/* 
* Problem Statement: Write an application named CollegeList 
* that declares an array of four “regular” CollegeEmployees, three Faculty, 
* and seven Students. Prompt the user to specify which type of person’s data
* will be entered (C, F, or S), or allow the user to quit (Q). 
* While the user chooses to continue (that is, does not quit), 
* accept data entry for the appropriate type of Person. 
* If the user attempts to enter data for more than four CollegeEmployees, 
* three Faculty, or seven Students, display an error message. 
* When the user quits, display a report on the screen listing each group of Persons 
* under the appropriate heading of “College Employees,” “Faculty,” or “Students.”
